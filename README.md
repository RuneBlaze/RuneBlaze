### Hi, I'm Baqiao 👋

I'm an AI/ML engineer, but when I am off I am more of a game developer, music arranger:

**Game Development & Music**
*   I mostly work on games in my off time. I'm probably best known as the "main programmer" on [Dragon Spirits](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1074190/Dragon_Spirits/).
*   I won the Gemini API developer [competition](https://ai.google.dev/competition#w-9) with my roguelike deckbuilder, Pen Apple.
*   I also had a stunt arranging Touhou Project music for the [Mad Hatter Tea](https://thbwiki.cc/LBQ) circle. I also used to sell [music](https://ceremonial.itch.io/horror-prelude) for the RPG Maker sphere.
*   I was once called a "paragon" by the Haskell IRC for my library [data-emoticons](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-emoticons)
*   I'm a proud supporter of indie games!

**My Game Development Style**

This quote about my game, Pen Apple, captures my thoughts well:
> 最後に、この「同人ゲーム」系の影響を強く受けたPen Appleが賞を取れるなんて本当に嬉しいです。アメリカ的な「Indie Game」からも多少影響を受けていますが、むしろ日本の鮮やかな「同人文化」がアメリカのIT系コンペでも評価された証だと言えるかもしれません🙂。

> (A brief translation: I'm so happy that Pen Apple, a game that was heavily influenced by the 'doujin game' scene, was able to win an award. While it also drew some inspiration from American-style 'indie games', I see this as a testament to how Japan's vibrant 'doujin culture' can be recognized even in an American tech competition 🙂.)

**Professional Life & Education**
*   **Day Job:** I'm an applied type theorist gone haywire for applied ML. Everything is a bit better with type theory :sparkles:.
*   **Education:** PhD in Computer Science from UIUC (2024) & BS in Computer Science from UNC (2020).
